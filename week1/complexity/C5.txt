5. What is the complexity of adding a single element to an ArrayList ?
   What is the complexity of adding n elements ?

Given a size of N, it takes O(N) time in the worst case as an increase (resize)
in size of the internal array might be needed.

Assuming the ArrayList is initially empty, adding O(n) elements takes O(n)
time. See for example lecture slides for explanation.
