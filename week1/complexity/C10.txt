10.  What is the time complexity of the following operations?

> Finding an element in an unsorted array of n elements

O(n) time

> Finding an element in a sorted array of n elements

O(log n) time

> Adding an element to an unsorted array of n elements, assuming there is an empty space at the end of the array

O(n) time

> Adding an element to a sorted array of n elements, assuming there is an empty space at the end of the array (the resulting array should also be sorted)

O(n) time
