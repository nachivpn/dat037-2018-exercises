Consider an empty queue and a full queue.
Both queues will have rear == (front - 1) % capacity.
Thus the code for size cannot tell these two cases apart.

One trick to fix this is to alter the queue constructor to allocate an
array one element bigger than necessary. That way the array never gets
full (provided the client doesn't try to fill the queue beyond its
capacity) and the trick for finding the size works.
