 How would you implement a priority queue using:

> a sorted array?

See lecture slides on "Idea 2" to implement an inefficient priority queue.

> an unsorted (dynamic) array?

See lecture slides on "Idea 1" to implement an inefficient priority queue.

> a binary search tree?

Insert: the underlying BST insert
Find minimum: get the left most node in the binary search tree (also an underlying BST operation)
Delete minimum: the underlying BST delete

Complexities (balanced / unbalanced):
Insert     - O(log n) / O(n)
Find   min - O(log n) / O(n)
delete min - O(log n) / O(n)
